Version 1:
the whole text will updated (instead of the highlighted portion)

I just realized this morning from the pdf was not clear you want the whole text or higlight text, selection highlighted text needs different treatment, working on it now, hope to finish by tomorrow morning

You can see the v1 code here on github:
